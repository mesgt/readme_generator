# Application Details

## Purpose

Documentation can be a chore for many developers. The goal of this app was to make ReadMe documentation a little easier.

## Description

This app was developed to increase documentation efficiency, and allow for consistency throughout all ReadMe files. The user is asked a series of questions via terminal and the responses and the applicable headings are then displayed with the file name 'README_1.md'. The user can further modify the file if necessary. The code is written using NodeJS with inquirer and fs packets.

## Technologies

## Future Development

Ideas for future development include:
1. Generated ReadMe output stored in an output file for user to easily locate
2. ReadMe file name to be the project title to prevent previously generated ReadMe from being over-written
